Here the task for each chapter will listed and optional Notes / Information

### Tasks
_go to portal for the tasks_

### Notes
* was build on Google Colab _(GPU was not used, since it runs fast enough, and google polices ....)_
* Added a second Network with one hiddenlayer, since this worked with my JS-Network also, and reduces calculation _(atleast in my "framework")_

### Output
_... the mark of > 95% accuracy was achieved ... :)_
