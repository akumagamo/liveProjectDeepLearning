(***Documentation last update 2020-08-18 18:30 CET***)  

Here the task for each chapter will listed and optional Notes / Information

## ChapterOne

### Tasks
_go to portal for the tasks, and more details_

### Notes
* was build on Google Colab _(GPU was not used, since it runs fast enough, and google polices ....)_
* Added a second Network with one hiddenlayer, since this worked with my JS-Network also, and reduces calculation _(atleast in my "framework")_
    * Some Metrics....

### Output
_... the mark of > 95% accuracy was achieved ... :)_

## ChapterTwo

### Tasks
_go to portal for the tasks, and more details_

### Notes
* was build on Google Colab _(GPU was not used, since it runs fast enough, and google polices ....)_

### Output
_... No transformation is necessary for the data, I assume ... :)_

## Summary / Open Tasks
* I should refactor _(extract functions, rename varibales, ...)_
* "Some Metrics" where displayed, but... _are they interesting or relevant?_
